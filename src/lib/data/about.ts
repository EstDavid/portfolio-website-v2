  description: `
  I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** with experience in the development of complete solutions in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem (React, Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB and PostgreSQL).

  After more than 15 years as **Mechanical Engineer in the rolling stock industry** (trains, locomotives...), I bring a global perspective and analytical capacity to complex projects.

  This are some of the things I have done so far:
  - **Implemented from scratch an admin panel** for a real estate application
  - Introduced a **complete test suite and implemented TDD** to expand the backend in a more robust, reliable and agile way
  - **Integrated Stripe** in a web app, expanding monetization from only iOs users to a much wider audience
  - Connected **AI agents** via the **OpenAI API** to automate real estate report generation and reduce delivery times
  - Promoted and **lead the adoption of Next.js** in the organization, establishing good practices and code patterns, and boosting the scalability of the app
  - **Lead consulting projects as Mechanical Engineer**, coordinating teams, conducting commercial and technical negotiations with clients, and making improvements in efficiency and performance

  What sets me apart: I possess a strong sense of **curiosity and capacity to learn** and adapt to different business needs. I combine my **systems thinking approach from Mechanical Engineering** with the tools and methods of modern Software Development **to join business intelligence with technical excellence**.
